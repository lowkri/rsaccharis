# rsaccharis
An R package for beautifying the output of SACCHARIS.

This package will use metadata .json and .tree files output from SACCHARIS v2 to generate annotated phylogenetic tree PDF files. Highly customizable, as the formatting of the tree is done using ``ggtree`` and ``ggplot2``. Of course plotting functions can easily be manipulated as desired.

## Usage
Install package using R/R Studio

``A_load_data()``

``B_plots_all()``

Follow prompts.

If it helps, our default plots used are domain_ECno_numeric, and we pretty them up further using Inkscape.

## Citation
Citation to come soon.

rsaccharis uses a number of other R packages to function. Thanks to those authors.
